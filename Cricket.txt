Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the world, especially in countries like India, Australia, England, and Pakistan. It is played between two teams of eleven players each. The game consists of batting, bowling, and fielding. The main formats of cricket are Test matches, One Day Internationals, and T20 matches.

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the biggest T20 leagues globally. Famous Indian cricket players include Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, MS Dhoni, and Sachin Tendulkar. Australian greats include Ricky Ponting, Shane Warne, and Glenn McGrath.

A batsman scores runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets or by hitting boundaries. A bowler takes wickets using swing, seam, pace, spin, or variation deliveries. Fielders must prevent runs and take catches to help their team.

The Cricket World Cup is held every four years. The T20 World Cup features fast-paced cricket and is widely followed. Key cricketing nations include India, Australia, England, South Africa, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand.

Cricket requires strategy, teamwork, fitness, and mental strength. Batters must read bowlers, bowlers must set fields carefully, and captains must make decisions based on conditions, pitch behavior, and match situations.
